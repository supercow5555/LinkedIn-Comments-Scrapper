# LinkedIn Scrapper

How to use:
1. Enter username, password for linked 
2. Enter post url 

## Version 1.1
Added list comprehensions on extracting names, headlines and comments.

### Performance
This script has been run on 3 different posts, with 37, 44, and 205 comments resepectivly with mostly success.

Sometimes crashes when it can't detect more comments, but usually works when you run the programme again... Will try to fix later
